See https://yihui.shinyapps.io/voice for the live demo. Make sure you have turned on your microphone and allow the web browser to have access to it. Credits go to [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) and also to @wch for showing me a minimal Shiny example. You can do four things on the scatterplot using your voice input:

- say "title _something_" to change the plot title, e.g. `title good morning`
- say "color _a color name_" to change the color, e.g. `color blue`
- say "bigger" or "smaller" to change the size of points
- say "regression" to add a linear regression line
